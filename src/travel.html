            The first place I visited is <span>Lalibela</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            I have always wanted to visit Lalibela and i did , the holy city of
            Ethiopia, where the ancient rock-hewn churches stand as a testament
            to the faith and devotion of the people. I was amazed by the
            architectural and artistic wonders that were carved out of solid
            stone more than 800 years ago. I felt a sense of awe and reverence
            as I walked through the narrow passages and tunnels that connected
            the 11 churches, each with its own unique style and decoration. I
            admired the intricate carvings and paintings that adorned the walls
            and ceilings, depicting scenes from the Bible and the lives of the
            saints. I joined the pilgrims and worshippers who came from all over
            the country to pray and sing in the sacred spaces. I was moved by
            the spiritual atmosphere and the beauty of the place. Lalibela was
            more than just a tourist site, it was a living and breathing
            expression of the Ethiopian culture and history
          </p>

            The second place I visited is <span>Dubai</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Dubai was an amazing place to visit, and I had a wonderful time
            there. I was amazed by the beauty and the diversity of the city,
            which offered me a lot of fun and memorable experiences. I saw the
            magnificent skyscrapers, such as the Burj Khalifa, the tallest
            building in the world, and the Burj Al Arab, the only seven-star
            hotel in the world. I also visited the rich heritage and history of
            Dubai, such as the Bastakiya Quarter, where I learned about the old
            wind-tower houses and the Dubai Museum, where I discovered the past
            of the city. Dubai also had many exciting activities, such as skiing
            in the Mall of the Emirates, which had an indoor ski slope, or
            safari in the desert, where I rode a camel, watched the sunset, and
            enjoyed a traditional dinner. Dubai was a place where I experienced
            the best of both worlds, and that is why I loved it.

          <p>
            Egypt is a wonderful country to visit, with many amazing things to
            see and do. I can explore the ancient pyramids of Giza, the largest
            and oldest structures in the world, and marvel at the mysterious
            Sphinx, a colossal statue with a human head and a lions . and I can
            also visit the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where you can see the
            treasures of the pharaohs, including the golden mask of Tutankhamun.
            and I am interested in the history and culture of Egypt, I can take
            a Nile cruise and visit the temples and tombs of Luxor, Aswan, and
            Abu Simbel. Luxor is home to the Karnak Temple, the largest
            religious complex ever built, and the Valley of the Kings, where the
            pharaohs were buried in elaborate tombs1. Aswan is a beautiful city
            on the Nile, where you can see the High Dam, the Philae Temple, and
            the Nubian villages
