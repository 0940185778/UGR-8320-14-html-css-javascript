              My name is <strong>Biniyam Assefa</strong>, and I am a software
              engineer student at Addis Ababa University. I was born and raised
              in <em>Woldia</em>, a city in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia.
              Woldia is known for its cultural and religious festivals, such as
              the <strong>Ashenda</strong> and the <strong>Timket</strong>. I
              grew up in a loving family with my parents and three sisters. My
              father,<strong> Assefa Mkonen</strong>, is a teacher at a local
              school, and my mother, <strong>Sisaynesh Asgidome</strong>, is a
              nurse at a nearby hospital. My sisters are
              <em>Burtkan Assefa, Eredet Assefa, and Mahlet Assefa</em>. They
              are all younger than me, and they are studying at different levels
              of education. I love my family very much, and I always try to keep
              in touch with them. I moved to Addis Ababa after I finished high
              school, and I enrolled in the software engineering program at the
              university. I have always been interested in computers and
              technology, and I want to pursue a career in this field. I enjoy
              learning new skills and solving problems with code. I also like to
              make friends and participate in extracurricular activities, such
              as sports, music, and clubs. I am proud of my achievements so far,
              and I hope to accomplish more in the future.

              <em>Communication</em> and <em> argumentation</em> are two
              important skills that I have learned from my life experiences. and

              actively, and adapt to different situations and audiences.
              Argumentation gave me the ability to present and defend one's
              opinions, beliefs, or claims using logic, evidence, and
              reasoning.they help me to interact with others, learn from

              acquired and improved these skills through various activities,
              such as participating in debates, joining clubs, volunteering, and
              working in teams. I am always eager to apply and enhance these
              skills in new challenges and opportunities.
